# Email Spam Detection

Daniel Cersosimo | Data Scientist 

This project is the end product of an opened ended task to extract insight from enron emails in some manner. Following intial explorations into the nature of the data, I fixated on 
conducting extensive feature engineering to develop the means of clustering the data into distinct regions which could be flagged for varying levels of spam. In an effort to assess these 
cliusters as distict groupings further, I build ML models to classify according to these cluster labels with the models performing quite well in predicting these now classes. For a more intricate 
discussion into the essence of this project, please view the notebook file which encapsulates markdown explantions embedded alognside the code with comprehensive comments. Thank you.
